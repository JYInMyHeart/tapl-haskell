Implementations from studying
[Types and Programming Languages](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/)
by Benjamin C. Pierce.

## Building

All projects assume you have GHC >=7.8 installed (though with
modification to `.cabal` build files, they'll probably work just fine
on 7.6) and a recent enough version of `cabal-install` to utilize
sandboxes. Then each project can be built with the following:

```
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal install --only-dependencies
$ cabal build
```

Examples of the implementation language can be found in `examples/`
for each project subdirectory to test the compiler/REPL.

```
$ cabal run examples/ex1.u
```
